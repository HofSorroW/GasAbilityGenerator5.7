# INPUT MAPPING CONTEXT (1)
# ============================================================================
# v6.5 UPDATE (INV-INPUT-1): Father abilities now use Narrative Pro's default
# input system. NO custom DA_FatherInputMapping needed.
#
# Input Architecture:
#   - DA_DefaultAbilityInputs (Narrative Pro) maps IA_Ability1/2/3 to InputTags
#   - IMC_Default (Narrative Pro) maps Q/E/F keys to IA_Ability1/2/3
#   - Father abilities use input_tag: Narrative.Input.Ability{1|2|3}
#   - Per-form behavior gated via activation_required_tags
#
# Current Assignments:
#   - Q (Ability1): GA_DomeBurst (Armor), GA_ProximityStrike (Symbiote),
#                   GA_FatherExoskeletonSprint (Exoskeleton)
#   - E (Ability2): GA_StealthField (Exoskeleton)
#   - Father ASC abilities (GA_FatherElectricTrap, etc.): No input_tag, relay only
#
# NOTE: IMC_FatherCompanion below is for FormWheel (T key) only.

  # GA_Backstab - Universal Player Passive Backstab Damage
  # v4.26 (Decision 4): Universal ability - add to player's Default Abilities array, NOT granted via equipment
  # NOTE: Runs on Player ASC - no cross-ASC gates needed
  # PASSIVE ABILITY: Contains CheckBackstabCondition and ApplyBackstabBonus FUNCTIONS
  # These functions are CALLED BY attack abilities - GA_Backstab itself does not activate
  #
  # AUTOMATION STATUS (v5.1 - Goal_Attack Query Approach):
  # - custom_functions: ✅ FULLY AUTOMATED
  # - CheckBackstabCondition: Queries enemy's Goal_Attack via Narrative Pro's built-in goal system
  # - ApplyBackstabBonus: Uses BP_ApplyGameplayEffectToOwner
  #
  # HOW IT WORKS (Goal_Attack Query):
  # 1. Enemy NPCs use GoalGenerator_Attack which auto-creates Goal_Attack when they detect hostiles
  # 2. Goal_Attack stores TargetToAttack (the actor the enemy is attacking)
  # 3. CheckBackstabCondition queries: Does enemy have Goal_Attack targeting the player?
  # 4. If no Goal_Attack OR target != player → enemy is unaware/distracted → BACKSTAB VALID
  #
  # NO MANUAL INTEGRATION REQUIRED - Uses Narrative Pro's existing perception → goal system

# NPC CONTROLLERS - REMOVED (v5.1 Goal_Attack Approach)
# ============================================================================
# BP_BackstabNPCController is NO LONGER NEEDED
#
# v5.1: Switched to Goal_Attack query approach which uses Narrative Pro's built-in
# perception → goal system. No custom controller or perception binding required.
#
# How it works:
# 1. GoalGenerator_Attack automatically creates Goal_Attack when NPCs detect hostiles
# 2. Goal_Attack stores TargetToAttack (who the enemy is attacking)
# 3. GA_Backstab.CheckBackstabCondition queries this via NPCActivityComponent
# 4. If no Goal_Attack targeting player → enemy is unaware → backstab valid
#
# See GA_Backstab custom_functions for implementation details.
