# NIAGARA SYSTEMS (7) - v2.6.11 Enhanced with user parameters
# ============================================================================
# v2.9.0: Niagara Systems now support data-driven FX architecture
# Two modes:
#   1. user_parameters: - Define custom User.* params (current method)
#   2. fx_descriptor: + template_system: - Use template duplication with standard params
#
# For fx_descriptor mode, artist must first create NS_FatherFXTemplate with Uber-Emitters
# See: guides/Niagara_Uber_Emitter_Setup_Guide_v1_0.md
